# hugo theme sso

This theme name is SSO(Simple Site :O).

This theme is made for people who don't like complexity and want something simple.

I created this theme for myself and am sharing it so that anyone else can use it simply.

Currently, many features are lacking and are being added.

Below are the features we plan to add for the next version.

> I want to give myself a round of applause if I complete more than half of the items below.

- [x] init blog theme.
- [ ] display categories, tags page content view.
- [ ] add theme config options for customize anyone.
- [ ] update search function.
- [ ] add tree view menu.
- [ ] add comments feature with another service.
- [ ] optimize mobile screen pages.
